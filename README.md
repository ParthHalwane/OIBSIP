I have performed the tasks.

Task 1 - IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Task 3 - CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Task 4 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Task 5 - SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON


I have downloaded the dataset from the following links:

1. Iris Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv

2. Car Dataset:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/CarPrice.csv

4. Spam Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

5. Advertising dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv



Open any IDE that can code in python. Now, in place of the "pd.read_csv" function of pandas in the code, just add the path of the dataset of your local machine after downloading.
Once doanloaded simply run the project.
